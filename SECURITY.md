# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, data breach potential, MCP protocol exploits
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, API key exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, denial of service, resource exhaustion
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### TypeScript/Node.js Security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with npm audit
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure coding practices enforcement
- Environment-based configuration management
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys

### MCP Extension Security
- Secure MCP protocol implementation
- Authentication and authorization controls
- Rate limiting on extension endpoints
- Input validation for all MCP operations
- Secure inter-process communication
- Extension sandbox isolation

### Development Security
- Secure dependency management
- Regular security updates
- Code quality and security linting
- Pre-commit security hooks
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Security-focused code reviews

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection
1. **Automated:** Dependency scanning alerts, monitoring systems
2. **Manual:** User reports, code review findings
3. **Monitoring:** Unusual extension behavior or resource usage

### Response
1. **Assess:** Determine severity and system impact
2. **Contain:** Isolate affected extensions or components
3. **Investigate:** Root cause analysis and forensics
4. **Remediate:** Apply fixes and security patches
5. **Recover:** Restore normal operations
6. **Learn:** Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Audits

### Regular Security Reviews
- **Code Review:** Every pull request
- **Dependency Scan:** Weekly npm audit
- **Security Testing:** On every release
- **Extension Review:** Monthly security assessment

### Last Security Audit
- **Date:** 2025-07-03 (Initial setup)
- **Scope:** Architecture review and security template deployment
- **Findings:** No issues - initial secure configuration
- **Next Review:** 2025-10-01
